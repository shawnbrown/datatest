Datatest Changelog
==================


COMING SOON (0.9.1)
===================

* Added impoved docstrings and other documentation.
* Update bundled pytest plugin to 0.1.2:
* * Added handling for a 'mandatory' marker to support incremental testing
    (stops session early when a mandatory test fails).
* * Added '--ignore-mandatory' option to continue tests even when a mandatory
    test fails.


2018-04-29 (0.9.0)
==================

* Added bundled version pytest plugin to base installation.
* Added universal composability for all allowances (using UNION and
  INTERSECTION via "|" and "&" operators).
* Added ``allowed`` factory class to simplify allowance imports.
* Changed is_valid() to valid().
* Changed ValidationError to display differences in sorted order.
* Added Python 2 and 3 compatible get_reader() to quickly load
  csv.reader-like interface for Unicode CSV, MS Excel, pandas.DataFrame,
  DBF, etc.
* Added formal order of operations for allowance resolution.
* Added formal predicate object handling.
* Added Sphinx-tabs style docs for clear separation of pytest and
  unittest style examples.
* Changed DataSource to Selector, DataQuery to Query, and DataResult to
  Result.


2017-11-26 (0.8.3)
==================

* Added module-level functions: validate() and is_valid().
* Changed DataQuery selections now default to a list type when no
  outer-container is specified.
* Added DataQuery.apply() method for group-wise function application.
* Changed ValidationError repr to print a trailing comma with the last item
  (for ease of copy-and-paste work flow).
* Changed sequence validation behavior provides more precise differences.
* Added truncation support for ValidationErrors with long lists of differences.
* Changed excess differences in allowed_specific() definitions no longer
  trigger test failures.
* Added support for user-defined functions to narrow DataSource selections.
* Added traceback hiding for pytest.
* Fixed bug in DataQuery.map() method--now converts set types into lists.


2017-06-11 (0.8.2)
==================

* Added Boolean composition for allowed_specific() context manager.
* Added proper __repr__() support to DataSource and DataQuery.
* Changed DataQuery so it fails early if bad "select" syntax is used or if
  unknown columns are selected.
* Added __copy__() method to DataQuery.
* Changed parent class of differences so they no longer inherit from Exception
  (this confused their intended use).
* Changed documentation structure for ease of reference.


2017-06-11 (0.8.1)
==================

* Changed DataQuery select behavior to fail immediately when invalid syntax is
  used (rather than later when attempting to execute the query).
* Changed error messages to better explain what went wrong.


2017-05-30 (0.8.0)
==================

* Added a single, smarter assertValid() method.
* Removed old assertion methods.

  bit-wise operators.


2016-08-02 (0.7.0.dev2)

* Removed some of the internal magic and renames data assertions to more
  clearly indicate their intended use.
* Changed data allowances to provide more consistent parameters and more
  flexible usage.
* Added new method to assert unique values.
* Added full **fmtparams support for CSV handling.
* Fixed comparison and allowance behavior for None vs. zero.
