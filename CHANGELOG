Datatest Changelog
==================

COMING SOON (0.9.7)
-------------------

* Added pandas integration for `DataFrame`, `Series`, `Index` and
  `MultiIndex` objects. After calling the new register_accessors()
  function, you can check your existing pandas objects using the
  'validate' accessor:

      import padas as pd
      import datatest as dt

      dt.register_accessors()  # <- Activate pandas integration.

      df = pd.DataFrame(...)
      df[['A', 'B']].validate((str, int))  # <- Use 'validate' accessor.

* Changed pandas validation behavior:

  * `DataFrame` and `Series` objects are validated as sequences when
    they use the `RangeIndex` type (this is the default type assigned
    when no index is specified).
  * `DataFrame` and `Series` objects are validated as dictionaries if
    they use an index of any other type--the index's values are used
    as the dictionary's keys.
  * All index objects themselves are validated as sequences.

* Added improved NaN handling:

  * Added NaN support to `accepted.keys()`, `accepted.args()`, and
    `validate.interval()`.
  * Improved existing NaN support for difference comparisons.
  * Added how-to documentation for NaN handling.

* Added deprecation warnings for soon-to-be-removed functions and classes:

  * Added DeprecationWarning to `get_reader` function. This function
    is now available from the **get-reader** package on PyPI:

    https://pypi.org/project/get-reader/

  * Added DeprecationWarning to `Select`, `Query`, and `Result` classes.
    These classes will be deprecated in the next release but are now
    available from the **squint** package on PyPI:

    https://pypi.org/project/squint/


2019-06-03 (0.9.6)
------------------

* Changed acceptance API to make it both less verbose and
  more expressive:

  * Consolidated specific-instance and class-based acceptances
    into a single interface.
  * Added a new accepted.tolerance() method that subsumes the
    behavior of accepted.deviation() by supporting Missing and
    Extra quantities in addition to Deviation objects.
  * Deprecated old methods:

    =======================  ==================================
    Old Syntax               New Syntax
    =======================  ==================================
    accepted.specific(...)   accepted(...)
    accepted.missing()       accepted(Missing)
    accepted.extra()         accepted(Extra)
    *NO EQUIVALENT*          accepted(CustomDifferenceClass)
    accepted.deviation(...)  accepted.tolerance(...)
    accepted.limit(...)      accepted.count(...)
    *NO EQUIVALENT*          accepted.count(..., scope='group')
    =======================  ==================================

    Other methods--accepted.args(), accepted.keys(), etc.--remain
    unchanged.

* Changed validation to generate Deviation objects for a broader
  definition of quantitative values (like datetime objects)--not
  just for subclasses of numbers.Number.
* Changed handling for pandas.Series objects to treat them as
  sequences instead of mappings.
* Added handling for DBAPI2 cursor objects to automatically
  unwrap single-value rows.
* Removed acceptance classes from datatest namespace--these were
  inadvertently added in a previous version but were never part
  of the documented API. They can still be referenced via the
  `acceptances` module::

    from datatest.acceptances import ...


2019-05-01 (0.9.5)
------------------

* Changed difference objects to make them hashable (can now be defined
  as members of a set or used as dictionary keys).
* Added __slots__ to difference objects to reduce memory consumption.
* Changed name of Selector class to Select ("Selector" is now deprecated).
* Changed language and class names from "allowed & allowance" to
  "accepted & acceptance" to bring datatest more inline with
  manufacturing and engineering terminology. The existing "allowed"
  API is now deprecated.


2019-04-21 (0.9.4)
------------------

* Added Python 3.8 testing and support.
* Added new validate methods (moved from how-to recipes into core module):

  * Added approx() method to require for approximate numeric equality.
  * Added fuzzy() method to require strings by approximate match.
  * Added interval() method to require elements within a given interval.
  * Added set(), subset(), and superset() methods for explicit membership
    checking.
  * Added unique() method to require unique elements.
  * Added order() method to require elements by relative order.

* Changed default sequence validation to check elements by index position
  rather than checking by relative order.
* Added fuzzy-matching allowance to allow strings by approximate match.
* Added Predicate class to formalize behavior--also provides inverse-matching
  with the inversion operator (~).
* Added new methods to Query class:

  * Added unwrap() to remove single-element containers and return their
    unwrapped contents.
  * Added starmap() to unpack grouped arguments when applying a function
    to elements.

* Fixed improper use of assert statements with appropriate conditional
  checks and error behavior.
* Added requirement class hierarchy (using BaseRequirement). This gives
  users a cleaner way to implement custom validation behavior and makes
  the underlying codebase easier to maintain.
* Changed name of ProxyGroup to RepeatingContainer.
* Changed "How To" examples to use the new validation methods.


2019-01-29 (0.9.3)
------------------

* Changed bundled pytest plugin to version 0.1.3:

  * This update adds testing and support for latest versions of Pytest
    and Python (now tested using Pytest 3.3 to 4.1 and Python 2.7 to 3.7).
  * Changed handling for 'mandatory' marker to support older and newer
    Pytest versions.


2018-08-08 (0.9.2)
------------------

* Improved data handling features and support for Python 3.7.
* Changed Query class:

  * Added flatten() method to serialize dictionary results.
  * Added to_csv() method to quickly save results as a CSV file.
  * Changed reduce() method to accept "initializer_factory" as
    an optional argument.
  * Changed filter() method to support predicate matching.

* Added True and False as predicates to support "truth value testing" on
  arbitrary objects (to match on truthy or falsy).
* Added ProxyGroup class for performing the same operations on groups of
  objects at the same time (a common need when testing against reference
  data).
* Changed Selector class keyword filtering to support predicate matching.
* Added handling to get_reader() to support datatest's Selector and Result
  objects.
* Fixed get_reader() bug that prevented encoding-fallback recovery when
  reading from StringIO buffers in Python 2.


2018-06-21 (0.9.1)
------------------

* Added impoved docstrings and other documentation.
* Changed bundled pytest plugin to version 0.1.2:

  * Added handling for a 'mandatory' marker to support
    incremental testing (stops session early when a mandatory
    test fails).
  * Added '--ignore-mandatory' option to continue tests
    even when a mandatory test fails.


2018-04-29 (0.9.0)
------------------

* Added a bundled version of the pytest plugin to the base installation.
* Added universal composability for all allowances (using UNION and
  INTERSECTION via "|" and "&" operators).
* Added ``allowed`` factory class to simplify allowance imports.
* Changed is_valid() to valid().
* Changed ValidationError to display differences in sorted order.
* Added Python 2 and 3 compatible get_reader() to quickly load
  csv.reader-like interface for Unicode CSV, MS Excel, pandas.DataFrame,
  DBF, etc.
* Added formal order of operations for allowance resolution.
* Added formal predicate object handling.
* Added Sphinx-tabs style docs for clear separation of pytest and
  unittest style examples.
* Changed DataSource to Selector, DataQuery to Query, and DataResult to
  Result.


2017-11-26 (0.8.3)
------------------

* Added module-level functions: validate() and is_valid().
* Changed DataQuery selections now default to a list type when no
  outer-container is specified.
* Added DataQuery.apply() method for group-wise function application.
* Changed ValidationError repr to print a trailing comma with the last item
  (for ease of copy-and-paste work flow).
* Changed sequence validation behavior provides more precise differences.
* Added truncation support for ValidationErrors with long lists of differences.
* Changed excess differences in allowed_specific() definitions no longer
  trigger test failures.
* Added support for user-defined functions to narrow DataSource selections.
* Added traceback hiding for pytest.
* Fixed bug in DataQuery.map() method--now converts set types into lists.


2017-06-11 (0.8.2)
------------------

* Added Boolean composition for allowed_specific() context manager.
* Added proper __repr__() support to DataSource and DataQuery.
* Changed DataQuery so it fails early if bad "select" syntax is used or if
  unknown columns are selected.
* Added __copy__() method to DataQuery.
* Changed parent class of differences so they no longer inherit from Exception
  (this confused their intended use).
* Changed documentation structure for ease of reference.


2017-06-11 (0.8.1)
------------------

* Changed DataQuery select behavior to fail immediately when invalid syntax is
  used (rather than later when attempting to execute the query).
* Changed error messages to better explain what went wrong.

-----------------------

* Removed some of the internal magic and renames data assertions to more
  clearly indicate their intended use.
* Changed data allowances to provide more consistent parameters and more
  flexible usage.
* Added new method to assert unique values.
* Added full **fmtparams support for CSV handling.
* Fixed comparison and allowance behavior for None vs. zero.


2016-05-29 (0.6.0.dev1)
-----------------------

* First public release of rewritten code base.
