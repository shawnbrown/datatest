:mod:`datatest` --- Data testing tools for Python
#################################################

The :mod:`datatest` package provides data testing tools for Python's
standard `unittest <http://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_
framework.  It provides classes for conveniently loading data, asserting
validity, and allowing for discrepancies when appropriate.

Data tests can provide much-needed structure to guide the workflow of
data processing, itself. :ref:`Test-driven data processing <test-driven-data_processing>`
can automate existing check-lists, help train new team members, and
quickly re-acclimate users who have been away from a project for some
time.

(If you're already familiar with the package, you might want to
skip to the :ref:`list of assert methods <assert-methods>`.)
